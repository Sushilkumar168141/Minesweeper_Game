Hello World!
I just tried to develop minesweeper game as project for coding ninjas android development with kotlin course.
It includes following features :
1. Three difficulty levels : Easy, Medium, Hard.
2. By default game will start with Easy difficulty level.
3. An option to create custom board with some conditions.
4. Mines to be flagged is shown at the top left corner
5. Timer is present at the top right corner.
6. Button  to restart the game
7. Alert Dialog when trying to restart the game when already a game is going on.
8. You can flag only as many cells as there are bombs.
9. Vibration is implemented when user flagged a cell, so that user can know that the cell is flagged.
10. Best Game Time and Last Game Time is stored for the game in the format mm:ss.
11. First click is free click. Means at first click you will never encounter the bomb.
12. Timer starts with the first click and stops if you win/lose/restart the game.


Conditions for custom board.
1. Minimum number of rows = 11
2. Minimum number of  columns = 8
3. Maximum number of rows = 40
4. Maximum number of columns = 25
5. Minimum number of bombs = number of rows
6. Maximum number of bombs = 1/4 of the board size.
7. Number of columns should be less than or equal to number of rows.

Invention :
There is an option to share your best time of the game.
